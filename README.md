Introduction
---
In the interest of getting more practice in creating landing pages, I thought it would be good to clone an existing landing page to get a feel for how it's set up, structured, etc.


The original design on leadpages can be found here: https://www.leadpages.com/templates/preview/KcvneBMTimR3TctzSbtVcX

Methodology
---
First, I opened up my Browser's Dev Tools to take a look at some of the basic stylings used in the template. 

After scaffolding the layout in HTML, I got to work trying to tweak the styling in CSS. 

I worked on the Scripting last, as there were several techniques that I wasn't fully familiar with and had to look up.


<br>

Tools I Used
---
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript ES6
- Mobile-First design

<br>

What I learned
---
Only had a handful of experience with RegExp. The original Template didn't use the Form validation that I was familiar with (where a popup is displayed if you leave a field empty or the value entered is invalid). 


### Tricky points
One of the major challenges was the animation on the Modal Dialog box. When it appears, it fades in and up, and when the user clicks on the exit button or clicks outside the Dialog box, the box fades away and descends until it disappears. Read up on what to do [on w3 Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php).

In additions, scrolling was disabled while the Modal Dialog was on screen.

So, my challenge was two-fold: 
- How do I prevent the user's ability to scroll the page while the dialog is up?
- How do animate the Modal Dialog when it comes in, and when the user exits?


I found a solution for the animation on [Stack Overflow here](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45604025/how-to-get-fade-in-out-modal-effect), and the solution to my scrolling dilemma [was found here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9538868/prevent-body-from-scrolling-when-a-modal-is-opened).

Items for further study
---

Now that I have an idea on how to animate Modal Dialog boxes, I want more chances to use it more. Also, I'd like to try different animations besides fade-in/fade-out. (Like zoom in from the sides and swinging when it comes to a stop).
